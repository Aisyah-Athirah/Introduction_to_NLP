Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I just finished putting together a slide presentation on one of the field within Machine Learning â€” Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I used the good old 5W1H method (Who, What, When, Where, Why & How) to break down some of the most common NLP tasks like:

- Sentiment Analysis
- Topic Classification
- Text Generation
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Question Answering
- Text Summarization
- Translation

Itâ€™s a quick, beginner-friendly overview of how NLP shows up in things we use every day â€” from chatbots to translations, to social media monitoring.

If you're curious about how machines understand human language, or just want a simple way to look at NLP, feel free to check it out!
